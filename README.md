This repository contains Python scripts for predicting salaries using linear regression and polynomial regression models. The salary_prediction.py script demonstrates how to use the scikit-learn library to build and train these models based on sample salary data. The script first creates a simple linear regression model and visualizes the predictions on a scatter plot. Then, it applies polynomial regression to capture nonlinear relationships between variables and generates predictions accordingly. The repository serves as a learning resource for those interested in machine learning regression techniques and can be adapted for similar prediction tasks.
